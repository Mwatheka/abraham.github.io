	God gives every bird a worm but He does not throw it into the nest. You gonna get up and go for what you want.

	Watch your words for they become your actions; watch your actions for they become your habits; watch your habits for they become your character; watch your character for it becomes your DESTINY.

	The richest places in this world are not the rich goldmines in Ghana, neither the diamond lands in South Africa, nor the oil lands of Saudi Arabia; but the cemeteries, because the greatest unfulfilled destinies are buried there.

	People don’t become extra-ordinary; they simply decide to accomplish extra-ordinary things.
	Abundance is not something we acquire but rather something we tune into.

	The difference between you and that person you admire is very simple; you see a glass as half empty, but they see it as half full.

	It is impossible to live abundantly without an abundance mentality.

	God’s grace is made sufficient within us for His power is made perfect in weakens.
	If I have seen further it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants

	If it is true that necessity is the mother of invention and   knowledge is the midwife, then I believe that creativity is the father.

	Goliath is never a too big problem to solve, but just a too big target to miss.

	Problems are the biggest opportunities to improve your quality, nobody will be famous if they on circumstances that everyone expected them to win.

	Do I dream, yes, in fact, I can only be I if I can dream and follow my dreams through.

	You see, if you don’t know what you are waiting for, even if it passed near you, you will not see it.

	Passion is more powerful than knowledge. A single hand with passion is far much better than thousands of them with papers.

	A word of encouragement is far much better than an hour of praise after success.

	I have a heartfelt conviction that everything that one needs to make all they desire is within them waiting to be discovered.

	People don’t care how much you care about them until they know how much you care about them.

	My great concern is not that you have failed; I want to know if you are contented with your failure.

	Failure is neither final nor fatal, the secret is embracing it and making it your friend.

	Winners don’t quit and quitters don’t win.

	Success is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.

	If you have made mistakes even serious ones, there is always another chance, what we call failure is not falling down but staying down.

	People are good because they have come to wisdom through failure.

	How can you ever learn how to walk carefully if you have never been hurt because you walked carelessly.

	Failure is, in a sense, highway to success. In as much as every discovery we make of what is true, every fresh experience points out some form of error which we shall afterwards carefully avoid.

	We all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it to.

	Our business in life is not to succeed but to continue failing in good spirits.

	You know in life the question is not that if you are going to have problems but how you are going to deal with them. Then, stop failing backwards and start failing forward.

	People with goals succeed because they know where they are going.

	Much activity does not translate into productivity.

	You are working hard yes but not smarter. Set a goal and you will work smarter instead of harder. 

	Take this from me; no one can ever get somewhere unless they know what they want, where they want to be and what exactly they want to do.

	You don’t fail in life because you lack brains or ability or even courage, but simply because you have not organized your energy around a goal.
	Setting a goal is the first step of turning the invisible to visible.

	A dream is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan and deadline.

	Goals are road maps that guide and show you what is important in life
	The most important key to achieving great success is to decide upon your goal and launch, get started, take action and move.

	A goalless life is a useless life.
	Health is  the state of complete physical, mental an social wellbeing and not merely absence of diseases or infirmity.

	Many people waste their time in life chasing wealth and when they get the wealth, they spent the wealth chasing after the health.

	Integrity is doing the right thing even when no one is watching.

	When you have integrity, you are the same person in public as you are in private.

	When wealth is lost, nothing is lost, when health is lost, something is lost, when character is lost, everything is lost!

	It is not what we eat but what we digest that makes us strong; not what we gain but what we save that makes us rich, not what we read but what we remember that makes us learned and not what we profess but what we practice that gives us integrity.

	Living with integrity means not settling with what you know deserve in your relationships, asking what you want and need from others, speaking the truth even if it might bring conflict or tension, behaving in ways that are in harmony with your personal values, making choices based on what you believe and not what others believe!

	If you have integrity, nothing else matters, if you don’t have integrity nothing else matters.

	Character is what you really are while reputation is what others think you are which may actually not be.

	Chase your passion not your pension.

	I have a very simple rule for you: unless you follow your passion, success will never follow you.

	It is easier to memorize this <q>people who love what they do never work even a single day.</q>

	Chase your passion like it is the last bus of the night.

	I am a perpetual learner, I will stop learning the day I will die, I will die the day I will stop learning.
	If you think you know everything, you actually know nothing.

	A leader that stands for nothing can sit for nothing.Leaders who tell the truth don’t have to remember anything.

	A leader is one whose actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more!
